Yesterday I held a presentation for about 40 members of the Swedish LLVM dev&user group. [If you're in Sweden and want to hook up, we have a Meetup page!](https://www.meetup.com/LLVM-Clang-Sweden-socials/)

It was about how the high-level language concepts of Tuplex (e.g. unified type hierarchy, uniform handling of functions & lambdas, and treating primitives as objects while retaining high performance) is achieved on top of LLVM's model.

[Here are the slides from the presentation.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dwG7nblp7rhlmUnk-vOafMDA5JEjk4q60C_OE6OoYiM/edit?usp=sharing)
