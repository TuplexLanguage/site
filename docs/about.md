## About Tuplex

Tuplex is a research project with a two-fold purpose:

* Designing a uniform, easy to write and read syntax, with powerful and efficient array, tuple, and custom container handling

* A language test bed for developing a proof-of-concept of dataspaces which guarantee data race safety in concurrent programs

It's been in development since 2014.


Tuplex is a condensation of the imperative language concepts I find most important, and exploration of my innovation of the dataspace semantics.
