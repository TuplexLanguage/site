## About Tuplex

Tuplex is a research project with a two-fold purpose:

* Designing a uniform, easy to write and read syntax, with powerful and efficient array, tuple, and custom container handling

* A language test bed for developing a proof-of-concept of dataspaces which guarantee data race safety in concurrent programs

It's been in development since 2014.


### About me

I have a varied background, from bespoke DSP software development tools R&D at Ericsson, to leading AAA game engine development at a large studio, to managing large cross-functional projects in major organizations. All the while, programming has been a major passion and especially the field of artificial language design.

Tuplex is a condensation of the imperative language concepts I find most important, and exploration of my innovation of the dataspace semantics.
